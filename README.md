# What does this script do?
Extracts the values of a wide variety of map layers, for variables covering a wide variety of environmental and social values, for a given set of locations and times. This allows the user to add information about natural, and human-dominated, conditions to locations and times where biodiversity measurements were collected.

# Getting started
## Preparing field data.
Your field data contains information on when and where you made biodiversity measurements, along with any field observations you may have made of the environment.
Your field data needs to consist of a CSV file with one row for each sample. At minimum it must have the following columns: sample_id, latitude, longitude, sample_date, spatial_uncertainty. The format for these columns need to be as follows: sample_id (string labeling your environmental DNA sample), latitude (degrees, with north being positive), longitude (degrees with east being positive), sample_date (yyyy-mm-dd), spatial_uncertainty (meters).
## What layers are being extracted?
We have selected a number of environmental and social layers which can potentially influence biodiversity patterns. These include data describing the natural environment, such as terrain and climate, human activities, such as land use and light pollution, as well as socioeconomic values such as access to health care and demography.
### Map layers describing the natural environment
#### Climate
The following data sets are used to describe climatic conditions:
1. BioClim.  The [BioClim dataset](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/WORLDCLIM_V1_BIO) has 19 bands representing different measures of temperature and precipitation to a resolution of 30 arc seconds (~1 kilometer).
2. Global SRTM CHILI (Continuous Heat-Insolation Load Index). The [CHILI](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/CSP_ERGo_1_0_Global_SRTM_CHILI) factors in the effects of solar heating and shading, due to the topography of the landscape, on evapotranspiration. These calculations are done using models of early afternoon sunlight as experienced during the equinox. Spatial resolution: 30 meters.
3. Monthly precipitation. We use a [monthly precipitation](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/OpenLandMap_CLM_CLM_PRECIPITATION_SM2RAIN_M_v01) based on a combination of modeled data sets such as [SM2RAIN-ASCAT 2007-2018](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/11/1583/2019/), [IMERG](https://gpm.nasa.gov/data/imerg), [CHELSA Climate](https://chelsa-climate.org/), and [BioClim](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/WORLDCLIM_V1_BIO). Spatial resolution: 1 kilometer.
#### Soil
The following data sets are used to describe soil conditions:
1. OpenLandMap. The [OpenLandMap data](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/tags/openlandmap) describes the following soil properties: USDA category, pH, organic carbon composition, sand composition, clay composition, soil density, soil texture, and water content. All of these values are calculated for the surface as well at depths of 10, 30, 60, 100, and 200 centimeters. Spatial resolution: 250 meters.
#### Terrain
The following data sets are used to describe terrain:
1. Elevation, slope, and aspect. Topographic data is derived from the [Shuttle Radar Topography Mission](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/CGIAR_SRTM90_V4). Spatial resolution: 10 meters.
2. Landform categories. The [SRTM Landform dataset](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/CSP_ERGo_1_0_Global_SRTM_landforms) provides landform classes created by combining the Continuous Heat-Insolation Load Index (SRTM CHILI) and the multi-scale Topographic Position Index (SRTM mTPI) datasets. Spatial resolution: 30 meters.
3. Watersheds. [HydroSHEDS](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/WWF_HydroSHEDS_v1_Basins_hybas_9) is a mapping product that provides hydrographic information for regional and global-scale applications in a consistent format. It offers a suite of geo-referenced datasets (vector and raster) at various scales, including river networks, watershed boundaries, drainage directions, and flow accumulations. HydroSHEDS is based on elevation data obtained in 2000 by NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). Spatial resolution: 15 arcseconds (~500 meters).
#### Ecoregions.
The following data sets are used to describe ecoregions:
1. Ecoregions and realms. The [RESOLVE Ecoregions dataset](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/RESOLVE_ECOREGIONS_2017), updated in 2017, offers a depiction of the 846 terrestrial ecoregions and 14 biomes that represent our living planet. Spatial resolution: NA. This is a vector data set.
2. Potential distribution of biomes. The [Potential Natural Vegetation (PNV)](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/OpenLandMap_PNV_PNV_BIOME-TYPE_BIOME00K_C_v01) is the vegetation cover in equilibrium with climate that would exist at a given location non-impacted by human activities. PNV is useful for raising public awareness about land degradation and for estimating land potential. This dataset contains results of predictions of - (1) global distribution of biomes based on the BIOME 6000 data set (8057 modern pollen-based site reconstructions), - (2) distribution of forest tree species in Europe based on detailed occurrence records (1,546,435 ground observations), and - (3) global monthly Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) values (30,301 randomly-sampled points). Spatial resolution: 1 kilometer.
#### Photosynthetic activity.
The following data sets are used to describe photosynthetic activity:
1. Potential Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR). The monthly [FAPAR data](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/OpenLandMap_PNV_PNV_FAPAR_PROBA-V_D_v01) set estimates the fraction of visible light being absorbed by plant canopy. Spatial resolution: 1 kilometer.
2. Landsat 8. Datasets derived from composite Landsat 8 satellite imagery, taken about every 2 weeks include normalized difference vegetation index ([NDVI](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/LANDSAT_LC08_C01_T1_32DAY_NDVI)), enhanced vegetation index ([EVI](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/LANDSAT_LC08_C01_T1_8DAY_EVI)), normalized burn ratio thermal ([NBRT](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/LANDSAT_LC08_C01_T1_ANNUAL_NBRT), and the [greenest pixel](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/LANDSAT_LC08_C01_T1_ANNUAL_GREENEST_TOA). Spatial resolution: 30 meters.
3. Sentinel 2. The [Sentinel 2 satellites](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/COPERNICUS_S2) continuously take multi-spectral imagery of the Earth, covering a given location once every 5 days on average since 2015. This data needs a few preprocessing steps. Because this dataset is huge with tens of thousands of images, using all of them would be very slow. We filter to a date range and filter out images with more than 20% cloudy pixels. We define a method that filters the set to only include images covering California. We also define a cloud masking function, which makes pixels transparent if the QA60 band indicates they have cloud or cirrus cover. And we reduce the ImageCollection to a single Image by using the median method, which sets each pixel to the median value from all images covering that point. Spatial resolution: 10, 20, or 60 meters depending on the band.
